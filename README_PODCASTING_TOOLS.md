# Context
There are many popular tools in a variety of platforms to subscribe and listen to podcasts (see  subscription guide [SB16](https://goo.gl/6DJjji).). (I use Doggcatcher paid on Android). It turns out to be easier to listen to audio files in this way without the chores such as manual downloads and checking for updates.

# Archive-item-to-podcast tool
Given audio files hosted in some internet site (like archive.org), creating a podcast feed involved some manual labor (adding posts to a blog etc.. as described in this  guide [SB15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XWLwJvtnfJctdNYx3qSDHZyDKLPeQ21o3eHNJfQ7Xj0/edit).). Now, this manual labor can be eliminated using a new open source web tool - deployed at [vedavaapi](http://vedavaapi.org:9090/swagger#/podcastsv1/getPodcast) , which can be used to generate a podcast. Further details regarding its usage (with suggestions for submitting to Google Play, ITunes) should be available using documentation in the linked page.
