# Why podcasting?
- **Listening to stuff is easier**. Several people (such as myself) might prefer to listen to audio books and listen to lectures (perhaps during long walks or commutes) rather than read or watch them.
- There are many popular tools in a variety of platforms to subscribe and listen to podcasts (see  subscription guide [SB16](https://goo.gl/6DJjji).). (I use Doggcatcher paid on Android). It turns out to be easier to listen to audio files in this way **without the chores such as manual downloads and checking for updates**.

# Archive-item-to-podcast tool: Usage
- **Upload** your audio files to archive.org items. **Update** your archive items by adding new episodes as and when you create them (perhaps right from your android phone as shown in [this subtitled YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpwDrXkW1zo&list=PL63uIhJxWbgg3yJqzeh8kCxMo55YUX50F&index=18)). This is a periodically repeated step.
- **Create a podcast feed** at [vedavaapi](http://scala.vedavaapi.org/swagger/index.html#/podcasts_v1) by supplying the necessary archive item links in the prescribed format. (You may refer to [this podcast collection](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KMhtMaHCQpucqxH3aVcmYmPvQyV9vmunvckV2ARvD4M/edit#gid=0) for examples.) This is a one time step.
- Determine your feed URL - If the feed changes rarely or never, you can copy and serve the RSS feed output from some other page (eg. pastebin or [github](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/rss-feeds/)). Otherwise, you can just use the vedavaapi api url. (You may refer to [this podcast collection](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KMhtMaHCQpucqxH3aVcmYmPvQyV9vmunvckV2ARvD4M/edit#gid=0) for examples, and to this  guide [SB15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XWLwJvtnfJctdNYx3qSDHZyDKLPeQ21o3eHNJfQ7Xj0/edit) for some steps.) This is a one time step.
- Share your shiny new podcast feed URL to your subscribers, and **publish your feed** to Google Play, ITunes, Stitcher and TuneInRadio. This is a one time step.
- Finally, let us add your podcast to [this podcast collection](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KMhtMaHCQpucqxH3aVcmYmPvQyV9vmunvckV2ARvD4M/edit#gid=0) if appropriate, by inserting a comment in that spreadsheet or by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/rss-feeds/).

# History.
Given audio files hosted in some internet site (like archive.org), creating a podcast feed involved some manual labor (adding posts to a blog etc.. as described in this  guide [SB15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XWLwJvtnfJctdNYx3qSDHZyDKLPeQ21o3eHNJfQ7Xj0/edit).). This manual labor can be eliminated using the new open source web tool presented in this page.
